I am still answering phones, talking to clients, updating SSLs, moving websites between servers, troubleshooting email accounts, and a miriad of other maintenance tasks.<br>\nThere is also troubleshooting (debugging) the ghost in the machine.  There are a number of reasons why these might develop over time. Everything Breaks given enough time and space, websites are no different.
