title: 'Tales from a Junior Developer Vol. 1'
---

This is my first post on this blog in a brand new series chronicling my adventures as a junior developer.  I am a self-taught and learned the basics while I was deployed in service of the US Army.  I began by using Code Academy, then moved onto other resources both online and offline.  Some of the websites I used in this process are:

- [Code Academy](https://www.codeacademy.com)
- [Github](https://www.github.com)
- [Treehouse](https://www.teamtreehouse.com)
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)
- [Level Up Tutorials](https://www.leveluptuts.com)
- [Wes Bos](https://www.wesbos.com)
 

It was a long bumpy road to get here.  I battled a variety of internal and external influences.  We are all plagued with self-dought, either momentary or persistent and about a variety of things.  The only questions is are we going to be honest about what these. **Most people can teach themselves these skills**

The first thing you have to do is learn who and what to listen too.  Some people might be surprised and give you surprising reactions but if you are getting enjoyment out of it, and it doesn't hurt anybody, you should keep doing it(I want to specify I am talking about programming and nothing else).

For those that are naturally technically inclined be aware that coding is only a portion of my workload.  I am still answering phones, talking to clients, updating SSLs, moving websites between servers, troubleshooting email accounts, and a miriad of other maintenance tasks.  
There is also troubleshooting (debugging) the ghost in the machine.  There are a number of reasons why these might develop over time. Everything Breaks given enough time and space, websites are no different.  The internet is held together with the digital equvialent of ducktape and superglue.  

>The real question is what do you want?

If I leave you with nothing else from this piece of my experience, ***You Can Do IT***

Until next time...
